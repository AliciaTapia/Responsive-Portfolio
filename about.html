		<h2> About Me </h2>

	<p>Hi! I am Alicia, I was born and raised in Mexico and moved to Houston one year ago. I graduated with a B.S. of Food Chemical Engineering. I started to work in CEMEX a global building materials company in the Planning and Financial area within the Processes and I.T. department. Working there for almost 6 years helped me to complement my finance and administration skills. <p><br>

	<p>Later on I was contacted from FEMSA; a beverage and bottling company to work in their foundation as a portfolio manager which helped me to realized that I had a strong passion for helping and educating people about their health by making them food conscious. <p><br>
 
	<p>On the long term I see myself as an entrepreneur. Given my background as a food chemical engineer, I am aware of the food deficiencies we are consuming today. With my recent SW Developer training at the UT Austin; I will have the skills in computer engineering that I need to create a healthy food app, helping kids and families to know the benefits of what they are eating.<p><br>

	<p>I am also passionate about traveling to different countries, trying different foods and cooking and because I like to eat and cook so much I need to exercise so I do yoga and pilates. <p>
